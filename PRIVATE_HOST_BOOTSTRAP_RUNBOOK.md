# ACI Private Host Bootstrap Runbook

Status: Active

## Purpose

Define the exact execution order for preparing `fumimaruwork/aci` as a private repository without crossing into any public-release action.

## Private Boundary

Allowed in this runbook:

- create `fumimaruwork/aci` as a private repository
- place the carried files listed in `REPO_EXPORT_GUIDE.md`
- add the chosen `LICENSE`
- promote the chosen wording from draft documents into the private repository copy
- run the documented verification sequence
- wire the chosen CI scope in the private repository

Forbidden in this runbook:

- change repository visibility to public
- announce or share the repository as public
- run public go-live actions

## Carry Set For Private Repository

Carry these files and directories into the private repository candidate:

- `README.md`
- `ACI_SHELF_CLASSIFICATION.md`
- `REPO_EXPORT_GUIDE.md`
- `REPO_EXPORT_CHECKLIST.md`
- `PUBLIC_RUNTIME_ASSUMPTIONS.md`
- `NON_GOALS.md`
- `DOMAIN_PACK_EXTENSION_GUIDE.md`
- `PUBLIC_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`
- `PRIVATE_HOST_BOOTSTRAP_RUNBOOK.md`
- `PRIVATE_RELEASE_HOLD_LINE.md`
- `core/`
- `python/`
- `domains/`
- `runtime/`
- `report/`
- `persistence/`
- `integrations/`
- `LICENSE`

Do not carry by default:

- `roadmap/`
- `tasks/`
- `design/`
- working records under `common/refernce`
- internal decision notes that are not needed in the private repository copy

## Private Repository Setup Order

1. Create `fumimaruwork/aci` with `private` visibility.
2. Prepare the repository root with the carried files and directories.
3. Add `LICENSE` using the chosen license text.
4. Promote `CONTRIBUTING_DRAFT.md` and `SECURITY_DRAFT.md` into the private repository copy after replacing draft-only wording as intended.
5. Keep internal-only files out unless they are intentionally needed for the private repository.
6. Configure the chosen CI scope in the private repository.

## Private Verification Order

Run the same verification sequence described in `PUBLIC_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` and `runtime/aci-generic-quickstart.md` after the private repository candidate is assembled.

## Hold Rule

Stop after private verification and private CI wiring. Do not continue into public release from this runbook.
